<h2>Persona</h2>
<p><strong>Name: </strong>Jessie Wilder</p>
<p><strong>Age: </strong>30 years old</p>
<p><strong>Profession: </strong> Founder and CEO of MindSoothe Inc., a startup specializing in digital solutions for mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Company Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> MindSoothe Inc.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus: </strong>MindSoothe focuses on developing innovative digital tools and platforms to support mental health. They offer apps and
        web-based solutions that help users manage stress, anxiety, and promote overall mental well-being.
    </li>

        They value creative problem-solving, collaboration, and are committed to making a positive impact in the mental health space.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technology Preference: </strong>
    Jessie is tech-savvy, often using the latest gadgets. She primarily works on a MacBook Pro and relies on her iPhone 14 for on-the-go
    management.  She has a general grasp of software development (enough to be dangerous) but doesn’t consider herself a developer. Jessie
    values technology that is intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient.
</p>
<p><strong>Attitudes and Behavior: </strong>
    Jessie is passionate about mental health and technology's role in improving it. She's entrepreneurial, driven, and always looking for
    innovative solutions. Jessie values clear communication and quick decision-making. She spends a significant amount of time networking
    in tech and wellness circles and is always on the lookout for emerging trends and potential hires.
</p>
<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Frustrations: </strong>
        Finding the right talent that not only has the technical skills but also aligns with the company’s mission and culture.
        Balancing the fast-paced growth of the startup with maintaining a focus on quality and user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Needs: </strong>A full-stack developer who is versatile, adaptable, and has a genuine interest in mental health.
        Someone who can contribute to both the technical and creative aspects of their projects, and understands the importance
        of user-centered design.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Goals: </strong>
    Jessie wants to be able to quickly assess whether a candidate is a good technical and cultural fit. She is willing to spend a
    little more time on a portfolio if it demonstrates a clear alignment with her company's mission, shows creative problem-solving,
    and reflects a genuine passion for making a positive impact in the field.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>User Story: </strong>
    As a user, I need to quickly discern if this candidate is suitable for our full-stack developer position and aligns with
    our cultural values.
